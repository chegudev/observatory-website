### What challenges did I face in this project?

Well, the critical point of this project was on the hover effect, where the mouse had to be moved precisely on the telescope, control table, and phone to display the png image; So what was preventing this event was the transparent background of the png image.

### solution:
Using figma, I made a shape of the same size as the telescope, control table, and telephone and placed it as a layer under each corresponding image, and then I assigned the hover effect to these images made with figma.
